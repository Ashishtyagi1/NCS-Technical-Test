HI My name is Ashish Tyagi,
First of all I would like to thank you for this opportunity.

I would like to mention that I am currently employed and been working for a company and to justify my role, I have to invest majority of my time to my current job. That is why I felt that there was a shortage of time.

Anyways I have tried to achieve all the required funtionalities and tried to write quality codes. Due to shortage of time I was not able to design the application to my full potential.
Anyways I hope you will get the idea of my coding techniques.

First I tried to use pure HTML and CSS for designing as it makes the apllication perform faster. But in order to achieve some functionalities in short period of time I also made use of Material UI and other libraires of react.

I have also tried to write comments above various functions in order to make the application and functions easy to understand.

I hope you would appreciate my efforts as I have appreciated this opportunity.
Thanks and Regards.
